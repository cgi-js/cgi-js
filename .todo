- [*] Work with embedding Database Servers (MySQL, PgSQL[todo], MongoDB) [Partially done]
- [*] Work with other using generic command process functions and executables [Partially done]
- [] Improve performance by reducing config parsing time. Consider singletons for non-dynamic configs [TODO]
- [] Move cgi file serving to be based on processes execute implementation keeping current method of cgi.serve implementation same [TODO]
- [] Add implementation of phpcgijs into cgijs - cgi.serve(filename, executable, args) without moving current method of implementation [TODO]
- [] Deprecate phpcgijs in favour of cgijs [TODO]
- [] Consider testing serving of js file as CGI executable like PHP, an option. Considering cgi-node as an option [TODO]
- [] Consider adding serving CGI file (.cgi) like PHP, an option [TODO]
- [] Consider adding tracer for errors. Reconsider error handling mechanism [TODO]
- [] Consider adding inbuilt PHP, Python, Ruby, Perl custom config based development server proxy to package api [TODO]
- [] Add middlewares for use with different frameworks for CGIJS CGI Files for all interpreted languages [TODO]
        ** Consider function name require('cgijs').middlewares.file.frameworkname(...arguments...) [TODO]
        ** Concept Credit - npm:http-php
- [] Add common function for creation of proxies (HTTP+WS, UDP, TCP, Socks, gRPC, Sockets) [TODO]
        ** Consider function name require('proxy').init(protocol, config, handlers)
- [] Consider Adding and Differentiating MessagePattern with EventPattern in the next major version [TODO]

        ** Check inline docs for .proxy.redirect section after line `redirect: {`
        ** Current proxy file does not differentiate Patterns. The file currently differentiates communication based on just protocols
